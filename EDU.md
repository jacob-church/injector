# A resource, for you.

This project represents a working, polished dependency injector, ready for use
in your projects.

But, it comes with a gift: if you're interested in how this dependency injector
works, then the [`/edu`](./edu/START_HERE.md) directory is for you. It contains
incremental implementations of this injector, starting from the most basic
features and working up into the core problems. Each injector comes with a
markdown file discussing the details, an implementation file with comments
marking the new features added in that file, and a few (working!) test cases,
demonstrating the functionality being discussed.

I hope this project will not only serve your dependency injection needs, but act
as a worthy educational resource as well.
